# TronMask  

The code for TronMask was contributed by a group of Third World developers.

Due to the extremely poor network environment in the Third World, a completely transparent, open and stable way to interact with the TRON blockchain without redundant APIs was necessary.

We have developed TronMask so that the Third World community can open the door to the blockchain.

TronMask supports Firefox, Google Chrome, and Chromium-based browsers. We recommend using the latest available browser version.

TronMask is Fork from TronLink Browser Extension.
